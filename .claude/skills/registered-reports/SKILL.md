rr.py init --title "T" [--journal X] — creates Stage 1 scaffold
rr.py advance --rr-id R --to-state STATE
rr.py status --rr-id R
rr.py list
```

## States (linear)

1. `stage-1-drafted` — protocol written
2. `stage-1-submitted` — sent for review
3. `in-principle-accepted` — IPA granted
4. `data-collected` — actual data gathered
5. `stage-2-drafted` — full paper written
6. `stage-2-submitted` — final submission
7. `published`

Backwards transitions blocked. `--force` overrides.

## Stage 1 sections
