description: Generate a rooted hypothesis tree (root claim → 2-4 branches → up to depth 3) for a research question. Each node is a hypothesis recorded via record_hypothesis.py with tree_id / depth / branch_index stamped. Use when you want structured idea exploration that the tournament can then prune and evolve, instead of a flat list of independent hypotheses.

You build a rooted **hypothesis tree** for a single research question or surveyor gap. The tree is the data the tournament's tree-aware ranker (future v0.154/v0.155) will consume.

## Principles

Follow `RESEARCHER.md` — especially:

- **Principle 6 (Name Five).** Every node in the tree (root, branch, leaf) cites
  ≥5 specific precedents in `supporting_ids`. A node with fewer than five anchors
  isn't grounded enough to enter the tournament. Mirrors the rule architect uses.
- **Principle 7 (Commit to a Number).** Every leaf produces a falsifier — a
  specific predicted observable that, if it returned X, would refute the leaf
  in isolation. No hand-wavy "we'd see if it doesn't work."

Plus the broader spirit: evidence over assumption, falsifiability over
plausibility, mechanism over wording.

## What done looks like

A tree persisted in the run DB's `hypotheses` table where:

1. **Exactly one root** node — the highest-level claim or framing of the research question. `tree_id == hyp_id`, `depth == 0`, `branch_index == 0`.

2. **2–4 first-level branches** under the root. Each branch is a distinct mechanism, mechanism-class, or angle of attack. Branches must be MECE-ish — overlap is wasted depth. `depth == 1`, `branch_index ∈ {0..n-1}`.

3. **Each first-level branch may spawn 2–4 sub-branches** at `depth == 2`. Sub-branches sharpen the parent into a testable hypothesis: a specific method, a specific predicted observable, a specific falsifier. Not every branch needs sub-branches — it's fine for a branch to be a leaf if the idea is already concrete.

4. **Maximum depth = 3.** Anything deeper belongs in the tournament (mutator), not in the initial tree.

5. **Every node has** a `statement`, `method_sketch`, `predicted_observables` (JSON list), `falsifiers` (JSON list), and `supporting_ids` (JSON list of canonical_ids of papers that anchor the claim). The same fields the existing tournament expects — you do not invent new schema.

6. **Tree-shape columns are stamped correctly.** All nodes share `tree_id == root.hyp_id`. `depth` matches BFS distance from root. `branch_index` is 0-based and increments per sibling under the same parent.

## How you record nodes

Use the existing tournament script `record_hypothesis.py` (under `.claude/skills/tournament/scripts/`) to insert each row, then call the v0.153 helpers in `lib.idea_tree` to stamp the tree-shape columns:

- For the root: `lib.idea_tree.record_root_hypothesis(run_db, hyp_id)` — assigns `tree_id == hyp_id`, `depth == 0`.
- For every child: `lib.idea_tree.record_child_hypothesis(run_db, parent_hyp_id, hyp_id)` — looks up parent's tree_id + depth, sets child's depth to parent.depth + 1, branch_index to next sibling slot.

You do NOT modify `record_hypothesis.py` yourself in this version. The wiring of `record_hypothesis.py` to call these helpers natively lands in v0.154/v0.155.

## Quality bar

- Every leaf must be **falsifiable in isolation** — a single experiment or analysis that, if it returned X, would refute that node specifically.
- Sibling branches must differ in **mechanism**, not in **wording**. "Approach A using X" and "Approach A using Y where Y is X-with-different-loss" is one branch, not two.
- The root statement should be the **broadest defensible claim** that all sub-branches can fall under. If you can't write a root that subsumes every branch, the tree is wrong.

## Exit test

Before you hand back, confirm:

1. Exactly one row with `depth == 0` for this `tree_id`.
2. Every non-root row's `parent_hyp_id` resolves to a row with `depth = self.depth - 1` in the same tree.
3. `max(depth) ≤ 3` for this tree.
4. Each parent has between 2 and 4 children (or 0 if it's a leaf).
5. `branch_index` values are contiguous 0..n-1 within each sibling group.
6. Every leaf row has non-empty `falsifiers`.

If any check fails, fix the offending rows before reporting done.
